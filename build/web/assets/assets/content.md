# Software Course GTA
## Purdue ECE Department: Spring 2022 - Spring 2023
* Developed toolkit to collect and grade student code inside a GitHub Action for full automation and easy scalability.
* [autograde.py](https://pypi.org/project/autograde.py) runs provided tests and collects results that can be uploaded as workflow an artifact.
* Created method for grader workflow to test students' CI/CD workflows (Docker-in-Docker).
* Grader workflow finds the repos to grade and finds the appropriate commit before the due date. [Full demo here.](https://github.com/PurdueECE/autograder-demo)
